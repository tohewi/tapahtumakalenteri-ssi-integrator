## Release 2.1 - Data Integrity (Planned)

| # | Requirement | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 47 | **Data Integrity Check**: Modular integrity verification between SSI and WordPress. (1) List all Cups owned by SSI login and verify each has a corresponding Tapahtumakalenteri event. (2) Validate date list file against both systems - all dates should have SSI Cup and WordPress event. (3) Verify cross-references: WordPress permalink contains Cup ID, WordPress content links to SSI Cup URL. Configurable by event type (e.g., Kupittaa Cup) and date list file parameter. | ⬚ Pending |
| 48| Design automation architecture with following assumptions: Continue with web scraping (Tapahtumakalenteri and SSI API access will not happen shortly). It is going to be possible to programmatically access mailbox to read OTP. Automation architecture should utilize agents and workflows. Tech preference Azure and MS Foundry. Agentic workflows should keep up to date with Tapahtumakalenteri events and perform reporting and data integrity tasks when needed. i.e. after an event. Agentic workflow should handle a batch request for new events or updating existing events. If this requirement is too large, split it into smaller requirements and into multiple versions to achieve suitable increments of functionality. Always make sure documentation and test automation is in place and adds value to users and developers, agentig or human.| ⬚ Pending |
